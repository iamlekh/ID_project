      'Discover the latest interior design trends that are shaping homes and workspaces in 2024.',
    content: `The world of interior design is constantly evolving, bringing fresh perspectives to how we live and work. In 2024, we're seeing a beautiful blend of functionality and aesthetics, with a strong focus on sustainability and wellness.

Natural materials continue to dominate, with an emphasis on raw textures and organic forms. Biophilic design is no longer just a trend but a fundamental approach to creating healthy indoor environments.

We're also witnessing a revival of bold colors, particularly in unexpected combinations that create dynamic and energetic spaces. However, these are being balanced with calming neutrals to maintain harmony.

Technology integration has become more seamless than ever, with smart home features being designed to complement rather than dominate the aesthetic of a space.`,
